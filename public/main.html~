    Matrix design goal is to facilitate testing personnel to generate test cases, according to the need of the project of resource distribution case.

Cover all combinations of two therefore are much smaller than exhaustive ones yet still very effective in finding defects.

    Improved Random and combinatorial(AETG)techniques

    Add weight to every parameter, make sure to cover the important combinations instead the random combinations in AETG by analyse weight,meanwhile 

decrease response time.
